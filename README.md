# REST API #

This is a fake REST API by me for learning express js.
This API contains CRUD request so you can get, add, update or delete data with request.

## If you wanna use this in locahost ##
1- Clone this repository
2- Install packages
	open the folder rest_API_express_js in you terminal and type : 
```
npm install
node start index.js
```

3- you can send you request in "localhost:9000/"
